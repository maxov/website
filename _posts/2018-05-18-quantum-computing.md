title: Quantum Computing Reading Project
---

During spring 2018, I did a reading project under the [Berkeley DRP][berkeley-drp] on Shor's algorithm.
Many thanks to DRP and Vyassa Baratham, my awesome graduate student mentor.

I read from some great resources, including ["An Introduction to Quantum Computing"][qc-book] and
Professor Umesh Vazirani's [CS 294-2 lecture notes][vaz-quantum].
I would highly recommend both for trying to understand this interesting field.

I hope to write some posts on takeaways from the project as well as more technical stuff about quantum computing
and Shor's algorithm.

In the meantime, I've uploaded my presentation here (click on the picture).
It goes in depth comparing quantum and classical computers, and has some detail on phase and eigenvalue estimation, and
how factoring reduces to order finding.
