Hello! I study Math and Computer Science at UC Berkeley.
I created this website to organize my teaching and writing.

I have quite a few projects on Github under [maxov](https://github.com/maxov).
If you want to reach me, the best way is to email me at berkeley.edu with the same username as my Github username.
