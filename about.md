Hello! I study Math and Computer Science at UC Berkeley.
I created this website to organize my teaching and writing.

I have quite a few projects on Github under [maxov](https://github.com/maxov).
If you want to reach me, the best way is to email me at berkeley.edu with the same username as my Github username.

My interests are always changing.
Right now I'm most into programming languages and statistics.
However, I'm always interested in some combination of math, and computer science.
To that end, I'm really excited about research opportunities in any of those fields, and I hope to
become an academic studying some element in the combination of $\{\text{Math}, \text{Computer Science}, \text{Statistics}\}$.

In terms of history, I've been programming for many years. I first started programming professionally in high school doing web development at Kifi (they were bought by Google after I left).
Then, I undertook a data science internship at Salesforce Einstein.
This summer, I will be working at Twitter on the Scala tooling team.

I seriously started liking mathematics when I came to Berkeley and took CS 70.
The class showed me how important math was to being a good software engineer,
and sparked my interest in math beyond applications to software engineering.
An area of math closely tied to computer science, like machine learning, programming languages,
or topics in theoretical CS, seems like a good bet for my future studies.
