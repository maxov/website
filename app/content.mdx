Hello! I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student at [TTIC](https://ttic.edu), fortunate to be advised by [Yury Makarychev](https://home.ttic.edu/~yury/).
I am broadly interested in mathematics and theoretical computer science.
My research focuses on using tools from probability, geometry, and analysis to design efficient algorithms for combinatorial optimization.
