## The correspondence between convex sets and finite dimensional Banach spaces
Let $K \subseteq \R^n$ be a symmetric compact convex set with nonempty interior.
Such a convex set is called a _convex body_.
We can associate a norm with $K$, called the _gauge_ of $K$, as follows:

$$
\|x\|_K = \inf \{t \geq 0 \mid x \in t K\}
$$

It readily follows that $\| \cdot \|_K$ is the norm such that $K$ is the unit ball of that norm.
A finite dimensional Banach space is essentially $\R^n$ using some $K$ as the gauge of a norm.
Further, the unit ball of any Banach space is a convex body; thus symmetric convex sets and finite dimensional Banach spaces are practically interchangeable.
The prototypical example is $\ell_2^n$, whose unit ball is the regular 'spherical' ball
$\{x \in \R^n \mid \sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2 \leq 1\}$.
This correspondence lets us translate inequalities with applications to functional analysis to nice (at least in my opinion) geometric statements about the relations of different convex bodies to each other.

## Factorizations
<Theorem subtitle="Dvoretzky-Rogers Lemma">
  Let $(X, \|\cdot\|_X)$ be an $n$-dimensional Banach space. Then there exists a set of $m = \sqrt{n}$ vectors $x_1, \ldots, x_m \in \R^n$ such that for all
  $t_1, \ldots, t_m \in \R$
  $$
  \max_{1 \leq i \leq m} |t_i| \leq \left\| \sum_{i=1}^m t_i x_i \right\|_X \leq C \cdot \left(\sum_{i=1}^m t_i^2 \right)^{1/2}
  $$
  where $C > 0$ is a universal constant.
