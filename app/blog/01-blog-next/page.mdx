import { PostLayout, metad } from '../components';

export const meta = {
  title: "Writing a blog with next.js",
  date: "August 9th, 2023"
};

export const metadata = metad(meta);

Previous blog was horrible jekyll mess.
Lots of such messes, for course websites.
Wanted to see if the node ecosystem would offer any better.
I think it may have

Took my inspiration from the following sources:

- https://academicpages.github.io
- https://www.joshwcomeau.com/blog/how-i-built-my-blog/

In addition to nextjs which is quite cool, also used

- https://mdxjs.com

export default ({ children }) => <PostLayout meta={meta}>{children}</PostLayout>
